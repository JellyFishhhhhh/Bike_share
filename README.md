# Cyclistic Project
The director of marketing at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. The goal of this case study is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From those insights, the company will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
