Base on the observations above, here are some suggestions: 

Since casual users typically take longer rides and visit popular stations more frequently, it is likely that they are satisfied with the service. Create targeted campaigns offering discounts on memberships, highlighting the cost benefits of switching from casual rides to a membership plan.

Introduce loyalty programs that reward casual riders for repeated usage, encouraging them to consider the benefits of a membership. For instance, offer a free ride after a certain number of casual rides or discounts on future rides.

Offer limited-time trial memberships to casual riders. This allows them to experience the benefits of being a member, potentially leading to a conversion.
Implement dynamic pricing where casual riders are charged more during peak hours or at popular stations. This can either increase revenue directly or encourage them to switch to a membership, which offers more predictable pricing.

Offer ride bundles for casual customers (e.g., buy 10 rides at a discounted rate), which can lock in future revenue while providing an incentive to ride more frequently.

Since casual customers use specific stations more frequently, consider enhancing the experience at these top stations. This could include better amenities, signage promoting memberships, or even staff assistance during peak times to encourage them to consider a membership.

Analyze why these top stations are popular and consider placing more stations in similar areas or enhancing the service in less-served areas to increase overall usage.

Offer promotions that cater to longer rides, such as scenic routes, guided tours, or partnerships with local attractions. Casual customers who already enjoy longer rides might be encouraged to take more trips if thereâ€™s an added experience. (Reference PokemonGo)
